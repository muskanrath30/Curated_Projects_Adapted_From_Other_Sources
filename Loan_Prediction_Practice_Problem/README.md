I have pushed the code alongwith the below changes:

1- XGBoost with GridSearch                                 
2- Dependent Binning, that is, combining applicants with 1,2,3 or more dependents into a new feature (A new feature named Has_Multiple_Dependents has been created)                                
3- Additional Visualizations, for example, scatterplots and boxplot for features like ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome                                                   
4- Feature named Improved EMI has been created                                                                              
5- Ensemble approach used (Stacking)

Upcoming/Future changes: Code for deployment would be incorporated (Changes would be committed to the repository)
